# fortune-k8s-demo

[![Build Status][actions-badge]][actions-url]

This project is an experiment with how modern web applications would look like
when using **Rust** and **Kubernetes**. It is based on [microservices-demo][demo].

It is a simple web application that returns a new [fortune cookie][fortune] for each request.

There are two isolated microservices. The frontendservice provides one endpoint
that clients (browsers) can connect to. The fortuneservice is a [grpc](https://grpc.io/) server,
that answers with 'fortune cookies' for each request. Both the microservices
use fully asynchronous Rust libraries and are based on [tokio](https://tokio.rs/).


## Features

- [x] Microservices talking to each other using grpc
- [x] Local dev setup using skaffold
- [x] CI
- [ ] CD
- [ ] Service mesh and open tracing

## Getting started

* Setup a local kubernetes cluster, using Kubernetes for docker-for-mac
(for Linux or other options in getting started, see [setup](./docs/setup.md)).

* Install [skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/) and run the application

    ```shell
    $ kubectl create secret generic postgres-password --from-literal=pgpassword=1234
    $Â skaffold run --tail
    ```

**QED** - Go to [http://localhost](http://localhost)
